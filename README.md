# Train-Shceduler

Front-end train schedule application



## Description
The system will allow users to input new train information, including the train name, start time, and frequency, and display the train schedule in a repeating table. The system will calculate the next train arrival based on the current time and the frequency of train stops. Train information will be stored in Firebase for data persistence and retrieved from the database on load. To reflect updated arrival information, the system will schedule a refresh every minute.
